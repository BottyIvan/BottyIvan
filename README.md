Web development professional with a specialization in frontend and backend.

I offer a comprehensive and professional approach to projects. My experience has allowed me to work on a wide range of projects, ranging from vanilla PHP solutions to custom implementations using various frameworks. In the frontend, I have created innovative solutions, adopting a modern and engaging design, with particular attention to mobile usability and the latest framework guidelines.

Considering myself an added value to the team, I am always motivated to tackle new professional challenges that allow me to grow and contribute significantly.
